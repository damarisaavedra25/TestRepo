## Table of contents

- Introduction
NOTE: This test reproduces all the escenerios required for the assignment.

This test contains Feature 1 and Feature 2 (which has 2 escenarios)
Feature 1 is divided in 2 Escenarios
Scenario 1: User creates post 
Which from my understanding fills out the New Post page, submits the information and confirms is already there.

Escenario 2: User fails to create post because of missing title
Same as before but user won't fill out the title this time.

Escenario 2: User fails to create post because of missing subtitle
Same as before but user won't fill out the subtitle.

Feature 2: User updates posts (which has 3 escenarios)
Scenario 1: User completely updates a post successfully
Which from my understanding user updates the title, subtitle and body aftewards it submits the form, then it must be redirected to form's detail page and match data filled in.

Scenario 2: User partially updates a post successfully
Scenario 3: User attempts to update another user's post and fails
User must get an  403 unauthorized error
